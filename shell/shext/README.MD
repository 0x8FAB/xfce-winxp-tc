# Shell Extensions
This directory contains source code for the built-in shell extensions.

## Structure
The structure under each directory is fairly typical for that of a CMake project library under `/shared`, only with some modifications for deploying a shell extension (aka, putting the library in the right place, so it gets loaded at runtime).
